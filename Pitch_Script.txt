PITCH SCRIPT – 2 MINUTES

Good morning respected judges.

In many parts of India, one in five girls drops out of school before completing secondary education.
The warning signs appear early – poor attendance, declining marks, health-related absences – but schools lack tools to act in time.

Our solution is an AI-powered Early Alert System that predicts dropout risk for girl students.
Using attendance, academic trends, socio-economic and health indicators, our system assigns a risk score: low, medium, or high.

When a student is flagged, automatic alerts are sent to teachers, NGOs, and authorities,
enabling timely counselling, financial aid, or community intervention.

The system is privacy-preserving, low-cost, and scalable across rural schools.
By combining technology with social responsibility, we ensure no girl is left behind.

Thank you.
